# Biography

In the past hypothesis-driven research in the life sciences has been the domain of experimental biologists, with the role of biostatisticians and bioinformaticians being one of support. This is no longer the case. As the “data-deluge” continues our research focuses on how to use biological “big-data” in order to create and test hypotheses.

Our primary research interest is in understanding how genes and drugs can coordinate changes in cellular phenotypes and we use this to treat disease directly or initiate transdifferentiations that can underpin cell therapy. We  approach these problems through the integration of varied data sources, the development of machine-learning algorithms and close collaboration with experimental scientists.
